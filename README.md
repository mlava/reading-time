This extension creates a new entry in your Roam Research topbar, that displays the estimated reading time for the page you are on.

**New:**
- make sure reading time is loaded to right of my other topbar extensions (Yesterday & Tomorrow, Workspaces, Table of Contents)

It will automatically update when you navigate to a new page.

If you stop or remove the extension the icon and time will also be removed.

You can configure your reading speed in the Roam Depot settings tab. The default is set to 238 words per minute (after _Brysbaert M. How many words do we read per minute? A review and meta-analysis of reading rate. 2019. doi:10.31234/osf.io/xynwg_).
